This project showcases how to pair the Adafruit NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip with Tessel.io's Ambient Light and Sound Module in order to create a dynamic reactive light and sound module.

###Installation:
Assuming you have node.js installed globally, download the repo and run `npm install`.

Using the neopixel strip requires flashing your Tessel's firmware to [this build](https://s3.amazonaws.com/builds.tessel.io/custom/neopixel.bin). After downloading run `tessel update ./PATH_TO_BINARY` to flash it onto your Tessel. Note that this build is not currently compatible with the Tessel audio module.
